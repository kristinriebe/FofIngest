How to write my own FOFIngestor
---------------------------------

* get curent version of DBIngestor from GitHub
* use the "HelloWorld"-example to start new module
cp -r DBIngestor/examples/HelloWorld FOFIngestor

* rename the HelloWorld-files to FOF...-files

* The DBINgestor library is also need and will do the main work.
The FOFIngestor is the building block that makes the link between the data (FOF-file) and the database.
Following things need to be adjusted:

* SchemaMapper: define all the database-columns and data columns, connect them with each other.
* Reader: need to define the given functions: get next row, get item in row (i.e. return pointer to 'result') etc.
* accompanying .h files
