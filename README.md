FofIngest
==========

This code uses the DBIngestor library (https://github.com/adrpar/DBIngestor) to ingest 
Friends-Of-Friends (FOF) catalogues into a database.

It assumes that these catalogues come in the binary format used by Stefan Gottloeber. 
Thus it is very specific, but can serve as an example for how to use the DBIngestor library and write your own binary reader.

The code is based on the HelloWord program delivered with the DBIngestor.

Data files
-----------
The FOF catalogues were created by Stefan Gottloeber, who applied his FOF algorithm
to find groups of connected particles for a given linking length to cosmological 
simulations. These FOF groups resemble something similar to dark matter halos, but
no bounding criterion is applied. For more information on the basic method, 
see Davis et al. 1985 (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985ApJ...292..371D) and for 
a description of the applied version, see Knebe et al. 2011 
(http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.415.2293K). 

The files were written with Fortran, option "unformatted", but direct access 
so each record is wrapped by a leading and trailing (4 byte) integer.

Each binary file is usually accompanied by an ascii-header file  (...info), 
which contains all the information about boxsize, redshift, etc. 
FofIngest won't read this file, but expects you to provide the necessary information
as command line arguments. See FofReader.cpp for options (or use the help flag) to 
get a list of options.

A data file structured as follows:

* one row per FOF group, containing following columns (4 byte int or 4 byte float each):
lkl         int     number of particles
iadr        int      
rc1         float   x coordinate
rc2         float   y coordinate
rc3         float   z coordinate of position in cosmological box
vc1         float   velocity components
vc2         float
vc3         float
total_mass  float   mass of all group particles
xv1         float   components of angular momentum vector
xv2         float   
xv3         float   
xlambda     float   can be used to calculate the spin parameter
disp        float   dispersion
vdisp       float   velocity dispersion
root1       float   eigenvalues
root2       float
root3       float
vol8        float   spherical volume corresponding to FOF group
delta       float   overdensity (mass/volume) in terms of background density
e_kin       float   kinetic energy
vect[9]     9*float eigenvectors of inertia tensor
ispecies[6] 6*int   number of particles per species, 
                    for dark matter only: ispecies[1...5] = 0
...         int     unspecified
...         int     unspecified



Features
----------
* Read given datafile and ingest the data as following columns into a database table:
(see Fof_SchemaMapper.cpp)

database    derived from file column
np          lkl
x,y,z       rc1, rc2, rc3 (shifted to box-range, if negative)
vx,vy,vz    vrc1, vrc2, vrc3
mass        total_mass
angmom_x    xv1
angmom_y    xv2
angmom_z    xv3
angmom      sqrt(xv1*xv1 + xv2*xv2 + xv3*xv3)
disp        disp
disp_v      vdisp
axis1       root1
axis2       root2
axis3       root3
delta       delta
axis1_x,... vect[0:2]
axis2_x,... vect[3:5]
axis3_x,... vect[5:8]
snapnum     [from command line parameters]
level       [from command line parameters]
NInFile     [row number in file]
fofId       [snapnum*10+level)*idfactor + NInFile; idfactor from command line]
ix,iy,iz    [floor(x/box*ngrid); box and ngrid from command line]
phkey       [0, must be calculated database-wise]
size        pow(vol8/(4./3*3.1415136), 0.333333)
spin        derived from xlambda

phkey = Peano-Hilbert key for the grid cell in which the particle is located, 
		is just filled with 0's, values can be updated via the database 
        server using e.g. libhilbert (https://github.com/adrpar/libhilbert)

* If swap=1 is given, values will be byteswapped
* Accepts parameters startRow and maxRows for jumping to the specified row and reading only a certain (contiguous) chunk of rows.


Installation

see INSTALL


Example
--------
An example data file and create-table statement are given in the 
Example directory.
Data can be ingested with a command line like this:

FofIngest/build/FofIngest.x -s mysql -D TestDB -T FOF -U myusername -P mypassword -H 127.0.0.1 -O 3306 -M 50 -a 0.5 -l 2 -b 1000 -n 100 -g 1024 -i 5 -m 20 -I 1.e6 -d fof_example.DAT

Replace myusername and mypassword with your own credentials. 
-s: type of database (e.g. mysql, unix_sqlsrv_odbc)
-D: database name
-T: table name
-H: host
-O: port
-d: data file 
-M: snapshot number (snapnum)
-a: expansion factor
-l: level
-b: boxsize
-n: min. number of particles in FOF group; NOTE: code assumes that FOF-groups 
are sorted by np in decreasing order, will stop reading if number of particles 
falls below this minimum 
-g: grid cells for ix,iy,iz, per dimension
-i: start at this row
-m: read at most this number of rows
-I: idfactor for fofId calculation

NOTE: One can also use -R 1. This would try to resume the connection, 
if something fails. But then be careful and check later on if all rows were 
ingested and contain meaningful values. Erroneous rows must be deleted manually. 
Missing rows can be inserted using startRow and maxRows. That's quite fast, since
the reader will just jump to the correct position. Finding out which rows are
missing takes the most time here.

The database table could have been created like this 
(see also Example/createfoftable-mysql.sql):

mysql> use TestDB;

create table FOF (
    fofId bigint not null,      
    snapnum smallint not null,  
    `level` smallint not null,      
    NInFile int not null,        
    x float not null,
    y float not null,
    z float not null,
    vx float not null,
    vy float not null,
    vz float not null,
    np int not null,                
    mass float not null,
    `size` float not null,              
    disp float not null,
    disp_v float not null,
    delta float not null, 
    spin float not null,
    angMom_x float not null,
    angMom_y float not null, 
    angMom_z float not null,
    angMom float not null,
    axis1 float not null,
    axis2 float not null,
    axis3 float not null,
    axis1_x float not null,
    axis1_y float not null,
    axis1_z float not null,
    axis2_x float not null,
    axis2_y float not null,
    axis2_z float not null,
    axis3_x float not null,
    axis3_y float not null,
    axis3_z float not null,
    ix int not null,
    iy int not null,
    iz int not null,
    phkey int not null
)

An example data file is also given in the Example directory.
