Installation
------------

To compile, define DBINGESTOR_LIBRARY_PATH and DBINGESTOR_INCLUDE_PATH to
represent the installation directory of the DBIngestor library:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DDBINGESTOR_LIBRARY_PATH:PATH=/usr/local/DBIngestor/lib -DDBINGESTOR_INCLUDE_PATH:PATH=/usr/local/DBIngestor/include ..
make
